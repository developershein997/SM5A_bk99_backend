After comparing both lists, I can see that:
Missing in product_list.json but present in prod_provider_list.json:
AdvantPlay
PrettyGaming
Present in both files:
All other providers are the same
So to answer your question: No, the providers are not exactly the same. There are 2 providers (AdvantPlay and PrettyGaming) that are in prod_provider_list.json but not in product_list.json. All other providers are the same in both files.
